# Machine-Learning
Machine learning involves the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. This repository contains the machine learning code written from scratch using Python and without utilizing any pre-built functions for machine learning models. It is a valuable resource for learning about the inner workings of machine learning algorithms. The repository contain a range of scripts and modules, including code for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and model evaluation. It also include examples of how to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world problems. Additionally, the repository provide data documentation in csv format.
